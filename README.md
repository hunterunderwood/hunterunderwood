### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my Githib profile! Here's a little bit about me ðŸ˜„: 

- ðŸ”­ This semester in AERE 361, I'm interested in improving my skills with C and Python ... then using these skills to put together a cool course project
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on my leadership/communication skills as this years project manager of the M2I Micro-G team
- âš¡ My favorite hobby is going to the gym ... if I can't make it to the gym on a given day, I'll substitute with another form of exercise like basketball, skateboarding or going for a walk
